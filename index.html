<h1>  Documenting Erasure </h1>
<h2> by Rheaa Rao </h2>


<p class= "intro"> Howard Skrill moves around with a messy trolley of indiscernible content. He is mostly bald, with patches of messy, white hair and is usually clad in washed out jeans and a sweatshirt. He sketches monuments and public installations around New York City to document their "erasure" with a change in political climate. </p>
<p> Skrill had been trying to track down two artists, Andrew Tider and Jeff Greenspan, for nearly a year, just for a conversation, he says, that will help him with his project on erasure. When the two artists agree for an interview with a novice journalist, he hops on the bandwagon. </p>
<p class="pullquote"> "They put their booted foot on top of the Eagle to throw a blue tarp over Edward Snowden’s visage to represent transparency in government policy," said Greenspan. </p>
<p> In April 2015, Tider and Greenspan installed a bust of Edward Snowden on top of a war memorial pillar in Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn.  For this, they sneaked into the park at an unearthly hour in the morning, when the park was closed to the public. </p>
<p> The bust was taken down immediately. </p>

<p>"They put their booted foot on top of the Eagle to throw a blue tarp over Edward Snowden’s visage to represent transparency in government policy," said Greenspan.</p>
<p>Skrill interrupts him with an ultrasonic pitch of laughter.  He bursts into laughter at the slightest pretext and uses it to wedge into the dialogue. For Skrill, this conversation is a thought experiment. He weaves into the absurd conversation with historical theories that neither of the artists are familiar with. </p>
<p>Skrill says that the Brooklyn Navy Yard was a site of “prisonship,” where the British kept several American slaves captive. But the state made the Grand Army Plaza a site of celebration of the civil war so that people would forget how poorly the Americans were treated by the British.</p>
<p class="pullquote"> "There was an act of vandalism taken place by the state...you were recuperating the monument because the state was instigating its erasure," he said to the Snowden artists.</p>
<p>Though surprised by this bit of history, the layer of significance it adds to their Snowden project excites them. </p>
<p> "The state doesn't want you to question a narrative that took a lot of time and energy to support," Tider said. </p>
<p> Skrill compares the vandalism of their work to 5 Pointz- a series of graffiti that was white washed before being razed to the ground. Tider and Greenspan are not familiar with this. Both say that they are not sure of the frame of reference to understand the significance of 5 Pointz. They said that 5 Pointz was not the legitimate space of the artists and belonged to the builders instead, inviting a whole new series of debates on the concept of ownership. They add that the Snowden bust will be displayed in the Brooklyn Museum this fall. </p>
<p> "You made it!" Skrill shrieks in a high-pitched voice. </p>
<p> "Or do you mean how dare we made it?" asks Tider, only half-jokingly. </p>
<p> Skrill chuckles and questions the paradox of Greenspan's rationale that they are more legitimate because their work is in now in a museum. They emphasize the prestige of the Brooklyn Museum. </p>
<p> The artists have moved on to other projects- comments of surveillance and incarceration. But Skrill still seeks buy-in with the Snowden project. He wants to start by sketching the bust to include it with other portraits for his project on erasure. He seeks to grow the project, and he makes abstractions but he is not able to say how he can be a part of it, and it a part of him. </p>
<p> In the meanwhile, Snowden is still in search of a home. After a tri-borough ordeal between different precincts, his stone form lies in Tider's living room as a paperweight. </p>
